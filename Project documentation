# 🎓 Student–Mentor Matching System

**SDG 4: Quality Education**

A Go-based backend system that helps students find suitable mentors by matching their learning needs with mentor expertise and availability. The system uses a transparent, rule-based scoring algorithm to recommend the most relevant mentors, promoting equitable access to mentorship and quality education.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many students lack access to structured mentorship due to limited professional networks, insufficient institutional support, and the absence of scalable digital tools. As a result, students struggle to make informed academic and career decisions, while willing mentors remain underutilized.

This project addresses this gap by providing a simple, data-driven system that connects students to mentors based on interests, skills, and availability.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Enable students to easily find relevant mentors
* Use transparent and explainable matching logic
* Promote equitable access to educational guidance
* Demonstrate clean backend engineering using Go

---

## 🚀 Features

* Student profile creation (interests, level, availability)
* Mentor profile management (expertise, experience, availability)
* Rule-based mentor matching algorithm
* Ranked mentor recommendations with match scores
* Explainable results showing why a mentor was recommended
* Command-line interface (CLI) or REST API
* Input validation and error handling
* Lightweight data storage using JSON or CSV
* Modular and clean project architecture

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Students provide their learning interests and availability
2. Mentors are registered with their expertise and available time slots
3. The system compares:

   * Skill and interest overlap
   * Availability compatibility
   * Experience level alignment
4. Each mentor is assigned a match score
5. Top mentor matches are returned to the student

## 🧩 Example Input

```json
{
  "student": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "interests": ["Go", "Data Analysis"],
    "availability": ["Monday", "Wednesday"]
  }
}
```

## ✅ Example Output

```json
{
  "top_mentors": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "match_score": 85,
      "reasons": ["Shared skills: Go", "Availability overlap"]
    }
  ]
}
```
